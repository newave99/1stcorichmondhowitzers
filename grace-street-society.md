Columbia, circa 1817

1142 West Grace Street

Columbia was built by Phillip Haxall, a wealthy mill owner. The house later became part of Richmond College, the future University of Richmond. In 1861, the entire school enlisted with the Confederacy. The school became headquarters for the Richmond Howitzers, a barracks and a hospital.
