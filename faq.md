**Frequently Asked Questions**

We know people have many questions about Civil War Reenacting. For instance, What is Civil War Reenacting? Who are the people that are reenactors? How does an individual become a reenactor? Where do I purchase uniforms and equipment? How much does it cost to become a reenactor?

**_What is Civil War Reenacting?_**

American Civil War Reenacting is a unique and fascinating hobby shared by hundreds of thousands of people throughout the United States, Canada and Northern Europe.

Reenacting is in itself a re-creation of a person who was a civilian, soldier, hero, criminal, musician, surgeon, nurse, or clergy during the Civil War.

Civil War reenacting is also a re-creation of an event that took place such as a wedding, dance,

execution, funerals, mail call, drill, tacticals and battles.

Members of the 1<sup>st</sup> Company, Richmond portray camp life which includes cooking, eating, chop­ping wood, maintaining accouterments, living quarters, and speaking with the public. We also partici­pate in military drills, tacticals and battle reenactments. New members do not have to be experienced reenactors, and are under supervision by company officers to show new members how a civil war sol­dier lived 140 years ago.

**_Who are the people that are reenactors?_**

The people who are reenactors are not professional actors or actresses. Reenactors are people from all walks of life that have an interest in American History and the Civil War. People who become reenactors come heavily armed with curiosity. It is their curiosity that draws them into the 19th century. Learning about a divided America and its people who suffered and endured the loss of over 600,000 fathers and sons in one of the most tragic times in American History.

**_How much does it cost to become a reenactor?_**

Initially Civil War reenacting is more expensive for those considering a military role then a civilian role. For instance, a 1861 Springfield Musket could run as high as $400.00, However as an artillery unit this is not a required item. Civilian clothes could cost anywhere between $35.00 to $350.00. All reenactors experience this sticker shock. The 1st Company, Richmond Howitzers and it&#8217;s members have items that can be borrowed until new members can afford to purchase their own items. New members are permitted one year to purchase their items.
