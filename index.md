Welcome to the 1st Co Richmond Howitzers
=======
![]({{site.baseurl}}//FB_Cover_picture.jpg)


The purpose of this unit is to offer an authentic portrayal of a nineteenth century Confederate Artillery unit, 1st Company, Richmond Howitzers. Organized to preserve the history and military tradition of the American Civil War era, we will achieve our mission by participating in Living History Displays, Reenactments, Lectures and Educational Demonstrations, Parades, Civil Ceremonies and other sundry occasions to so educate and entertain the public and our membership. Organized as a volunteer unit, all members partake in the responsibilities of education and presentation. As such, our members are encouraged to participate as often as possible, improving their education and ensuring the overall safety of the group.
